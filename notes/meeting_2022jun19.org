*** topics
**** perl
***** perl 5.36 is out, showing some nice progress
****** features:
******* basic sub sigs, no longer "experimental" 
******* more flexible for loops, getting more raku-ish

****** the psc has clarified they're committed to backwards compatibility (within reason)
****** no published criteria for when they'll declare "Perl 7"
******* I'm pretty sure it's waiting on Corina
******* (ovid's guess is that could be a few years)

**** continuing adventures with move/copy/rename
***** roast test checks whether the old file name is gone after rename
****** roast/S32-io/rename.t
***** I found I needed to unlink the old after a rename
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022mar13/tagger.raku
***** how can you resolve that contradiction? 
****** try this: roast test uses temp files in current directory
******* /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/darkroast/S32-io/rename.t
******* eventually this will bt out: https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast
***** some basics
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022jun05/trial-mkdir.raku

****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022jun05/comma_equals_of_doom.raku
****** testing exceptions in code
https://docs.raku.org/language/testing
****** can use a try block to convert die to warn

***** equivalent of perl's optional export/imports
****** some people actually create individual tags for every item they want to export

***** .list and .List
****** if you write your own .List does .list see it? A: no, .list still works as always

****** operators are functions
****** can you easily define a recursive operator
