*** topics from last meeting (June 19th)
**** the double-asterix non-flattening slurpy array signature
***** so the single asterix is flattening?
***** TODO investigate further, for next time

**** regex feature: control what's captured with <( ... )>
***** from an old question in my notes:
****** Q: what's the Raku equivalent for p5's \K?
***** <( isn't really equivalent to <(
***** can do it with zero-width after/before matches
***** or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.
****** TODO try a variant without a named pattern ala quoted: what if it's embedded?

**** rob ramsbottom
***** rob opened a github issue, no action:

******* I have a file that got dates from 01/01/2020 to 04/04/2021 I want to get only the dates between 01/03/2020 to 01/03/2021 by using egrep. I tried to do

******** raku -ne 'my $ts = .subst(/ ^ (\d**2) \/ (\d**2) \/ (\d**4) /, {"$2-$1-$0"}).Date; say $ts if Date.new("2020-03-01") < $ts < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file

******** raku -ne '.say if Date.new("2020-03-01") < S/ ^ (\d**2) \/ (\d**2) \/ (\d**4) /{"$2-$1-$0"}/.Date < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file

**** the toddandmargo show on perl6-users
***** diy amateur encyrption... uh.

*** from the last meeting notes
**** continuing adventures with move/copy/rename
***** roast test checks whether the old file name is gone after rename
****** roast/S32-io/rename.t
***** I found I needed to unlink the old after a rename
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022mar13/tagger.raku
***** how can you resolve that contradiction? 
****** try this: roast test uses temp files in current directory
******* /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/darkroast/S32-io/rename.t
******* eventually will be here: https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast
***** some basics
