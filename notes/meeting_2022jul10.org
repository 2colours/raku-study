****** gluing together last two array elements into one

******* /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2022jul10/string_together_last_two_into_one.raku
****** small point:
******* perl pulled ahead on unicode *because* it was late in adopting it: utf-8 era vs utf-16
****** some good bits:
******* raku lets you define operators like the built-in ones, *except* for ternaries
******* complex math requires complex arguments to "turn it on"
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my $i = sqrt( -1 );       ## DOESN'T WORK.
my $i = sqrt( -1 + 0i );  ## works
#+END_SRC
******* nice lazy list examples
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
  my @lines = $filename.IO.lines();
  my @primes = grep &is-prime, 0..Inf;
#+END_SRC

*** haskell's span
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72809469/in-raku-how-does-one-write-the-equivalent-of-haskells-span-function

*** why is perl still relevant:
**** https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.blog%2F2022%2F07%2F06%2Fwhy-perl-is-still-relevant-in-2022%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3aI-NUWmi9G4Fg8w95CYio

*** topics from last meeting (June 19th)
*** regex feature: control what's captured with <( ... )>
***** <( isn't really equivalent to \K in a substitution
***** can do it with zero-width after/before matches
***** or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.

***** william michels turned up this on the subject:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63426361/raku-effect-of-capture-markers-is-lost-higher-up

**** the double-asterix non-flattening slurpy array signature
***** so the single asterix is flattening?
***** TODO investigate further, for next time


**** rob ramsbottom
***** rob opened a github issue, no action:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4945
****** TODO add some comments, at the very least confirm the behavior.

**** rename, move, copy
***** difficulty reproducing the problem
****** current theory: rename was "failing" after the copy, and silently skipping the ulink, even though the copies were being made

**** unix.stackexchange
***** william michels
****** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/706744/write-a-regular-expression-whose-output-will-only-be-rows-in-a-range-01-03-2021/706773#706773

******* I have a file that got dates from 01/01/2020 to 04/04/2021 I want to get only the dates between 01/03/2020 to 01/03/2021 by using egrep. I tried to do

******** raku -ne 'my $ts = .subst(/ ^ (\d**2) \/ (\d**2) \/ (\d**4) /, {"$2-$1-$0"}).Date; say $ts if Date.new("2020-03-01") < $ts < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file

******** raku -ne '.say if Date.new("2020-03-01") < S/ ^ (\d**2) \/ (\d**2) \/ (\d**4) /{"$2-$1-$0"}/.Date < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file

*** for future meetings
