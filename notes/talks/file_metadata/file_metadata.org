           If @suffixes are given each element is a pattern (either a string
           or a "qr//") matched against the end of the $filename.  The
           matching portion is removed and becomes the $suffix.

                # On Unix returns ("baz", "/foo/bar/", ".txt")
                fileparse("/foo/bar/baz.txt", qr/\.[^.]*/);
