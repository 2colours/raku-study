* Thoughts on doing Data::Math in Raku
** I haven't gone very far with this yet.
*** tune-in to the next Raku Study Group on June 20th
**** https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Perl/
** rummaging around in the toolbox
*** introspection features are built-in
**** perl: "ref", "reftype" 
**** raku: .WHAT, .^name, .^mro
*** lookslikenumber => can a string numify?
**** You can just try it, call .Numeric and see if it worked

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
if '33333'.Numeric { say 'true!' } else { say 'not.' } # true!
if 'three'.Numeric { say 'true!' } else { say 'not.' } # not.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
## special type that also takes a string that looks like a num 
subset Numesque of Any where { defined .Numeric };
#+END_SRC
*** raku features include operators for zip, reduction, cross products...
