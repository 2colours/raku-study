* raku case vs multidispatch
** case
*** uses lexical sequence to order comparisons
** multidispatch
*** uses specificity to order comparisons (mostly)
**** in the case of subsets, uses order of definition
***** groups subsets by the type they're based on
***** then uses the order of definition of subsets based on same type
