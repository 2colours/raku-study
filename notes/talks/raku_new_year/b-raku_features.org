* What's good about Raku?
** saner numerics built-in
*** big integers 
*** rational numbers
****  reduce chances of floating-point weirdness
** custom parsing via grammars and regexs
*** regexs redesigned, cleaned up
*** flexible pattern decomposition via grammars
**** better than perl's interpolated qrs
*** raku uses these grammars to parse itself: they *have* to work well
