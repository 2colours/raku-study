* raku syntax vs perl
** raku continues to have a perlish feel, but--
*** object method calls via the more standard ".", not the "->"
**** string concationation is now "~" not "."
*** variable names typically have sigils still: $, @, %
**** the @ and % sigils now behave like part of the name, they're invariant:
***** Perl
#+BEGIN_SRC perl
my %fried;
$fried{eggs} = 2;
#+END_SRC 
***** Raku
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my %fried;
%fried<eggs> = 2;
#+END_SRC 


**** you can have names sans sigils
