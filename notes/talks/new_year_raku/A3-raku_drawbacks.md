# Drawbacks


<a id="org691e4f0"></a>

## start-up speed is slow


<a id="orgac48ba0"></a>

### but Jonathan Worthington is on it

1.  the "new AST project"


<a id="org6fc5c13"></a>

## language is huge


<a id="orgba557ed"></a>

### an advantage: need fewer extenions libraries; it's multi-paradigm, etc


<a id="org04a5465"></a>

### BUT: while getting started not too bad, becoming expert can take long


<a id="org8eb389d"></a>

## experts vs newbies


<a id="org88a813b"></a>

### the insiders have been on this for decades


<a id="org95fc2a4"></a>

### many disputes, albiet minor ones:

1.  is an error message confusing, is that documentation sketchy?

2.  peeve: code examples that don't stay on point, always want to show all the features

    1.  (but please don't expect much better from me)


<a id="org31e96ab"></a>

## project setup/design


<a id="org3d97059"></a>

### reservations about "the tests are the spec"

1.  opinion: the tests are the tests&#x2013; resist mission creep


<a id="org3382507"></a>

### "OOP all the way down" => no clear boundary between internals and externals

1.  good in some ways: small step for an Raku expert to become a core dev

2.  bad in others: few limits to what an expert needs to know
