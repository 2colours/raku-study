# Drawbacks


<a id="orgb8a672f"></a>

## start-up speed is slow


<a id="orgd164ce6"></a>

### but Jonathan Worthington is on it

1.  the "new AST project"


<a id="orgebcb940"></a>

## language is huge


<a id="org62590bf"></a>

### an advantage: need fewer extenions libraries; it's multi-paradigm, etc


<a id="orgfb0cdad"></a>

### BUT: while getting started not too bad, becoming expert can take long


<a id="org15487be"></a>

## experts vs newbies


<a id="org1587497"></a>

### the insiders have been on this for decades


<a id="org846c2f6"></a>

### many disputes, albiet minor ones:

1.  is an error message confusing, is that documentation sketchy?

2.  peeve: code examples that don't stay on point, always want to show all the features

    1.  (but please don't expect much better from me)


<a id="org47e1a44"></a>

## project setup/design


<a id="org34fd6d6"></a>

### reservations about "the tests are the spec"

1.  opinion: the tests are the tests&#x2013; resist mission creep


<a id="orgced34f0"></a>

### "OOP all the way down" => no clear boundary between internals and externals
