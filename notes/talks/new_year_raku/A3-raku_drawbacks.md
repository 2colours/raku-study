# Drawbacks


<a id="org7602035"></a>

## start-up speed is slow


<a id="org270baf4"></a>

### but Jonathan Worthington is on it

1.  the "new AST project"


<a id="org75076a0"></a>

## language is huge


<a id="orgc14cb33"></a>

### an advantage: need fewer extenions libraries; it's multi-paradigm, etc


<a id="org2a19c33"></a>

### BUT: getting started not too bad, becoming expert can take long


<a id="org3919a0c"></a>

## experts vs newbies


<a id="org02ed702"></a>

### the insiders have been on this for decades


<a id="org9eaa391"></a>

### many disputes, albiet minor ones: is an error message confusing, documentation sketchy?

1.  peeve: code examples that don't stay on point, always want to show all the features

    1.  (but please don't expect much better from me)


<a id="orgaa874bb"></a>

## project setup/design


<a id="orgc0b77ad"></a>

### reservations about "the tests are the spec"

1.  opinion: the tests are the tests&#x2013; resist mission creep


<a id="org34dcd89"></a>

### "OOP all the way down" => no clear boundary between internals and externals
