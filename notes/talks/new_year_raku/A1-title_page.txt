    Some Adventures with Raku over the Last Year


    Joseph Brenner

    I'm "doom" or "doomvox" in various places (github, cpan, gmail).
    (I was a college radio DJ: "The Voice of Doom" at KZSU.)

    I run the SF Perl "Raku Study Group" (next one on January 16th)
      https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Perl/ 
    
    Note: the "slides" for this talk will eventually be published here:
