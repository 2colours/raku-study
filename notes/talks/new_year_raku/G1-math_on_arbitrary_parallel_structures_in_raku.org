* Doing operations on arbitrary parallel datastructures in Raku
** A rewrite of Data::Math for Raku
*** Data::DualMap
**** a work in progress, not yet published
**** uses multidispatch heavily
**** entry point modules export a wrapper function that calls the recursive code
**** different entrypoints for different purposes, e.g. "dualmap-numerics"
***** different from Data::Math where I just DWIM'd presuming you want to act on numbers
**** handling code blocks as operations was easy to implement
***** code example: /home/doom/End/Cave/DualMap/Wall/Data-DualMap/t/06-dualmap-numerics_with_codeblock.t
***** code in: /home/doom/End/Cave/DualMap/Wall/Data-DualMap/lib/Data/DualMap/Recurse/Numerics.rakumod
****** search from Block
**** outstanding issues
***** general cleanup (e.g. has comments like "no idea why I needed to do this")
***** want to support set operations (probably another entry point routine...)
***** not entirely confident in Data::Qualify and "compatible_types"
***** still don't see a clean way to handle custom data container objects
