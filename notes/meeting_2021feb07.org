**** I liked William Michel's code:
***** working, practical code
***** can see how solution evolved 
**** rotate
***** aside: at last I used 'with' (but bruce gray points out 'given' is better there)
**** custom sort
***** TODO translate to abcd and do a single char sort?
**** a recursive solution?
**** better to Test, which means better to use a library
*** grammar parsing examples
**** handling ini-style data
https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Subrules
**** Moritz Lenz book
*** Lambert Lum's balanced braces question
*** raku "queues":
