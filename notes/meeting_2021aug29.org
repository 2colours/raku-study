* meeting notes August 29, 2021
** hidden agenda
*** TODO 
** before I forget
*** the argument to round might be called "nearest"
"round off to the nearest"

** multiple dispatch

Larry Wall on Raku:

"We don't actually have types for the benefit of strong typing.
That's third place.  Second place is we can optimize better.  But
first place is actually it's there for multiple dispatch."

   -- Erlang & Elixir Factory, 2017

Douglas Crockford:

"But it turns out that strong typing does not eliminate the
need for careful testing.  And I have found in my work that the
sorts of errors that strong type checking finds are not the
errors I worry about."  

   -- "Javascript: The Good Parts" (2008)

*** standard complaint
**** we could check whether strong typing helps
***** e.g. conduct experiments where teams of programmers compete
***** but computer "scientists" don't do experiments
****** not if it means consulting with a social scienctist
***** unverified claims about human cognitive abilities abound

*** using multi-dispatch for "dualmap"
**** kind of cool
***** implementing this feature in raku took little code:
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my $dmh = Data::Dualmap::Recurse::Numerics.new( 
          string_handler => 
             { do if ( $^a eq $^b ) { "Both: $a" } else { "1: $a  2: $b" } } );
my $result = $dmh.dualmap( '-', $gross, $costs );
#+END_SRC
**** a little tricky to think about
***** it isn't *exactly* like a case statement
****** but the "is default" feature helps

*** dualmap status
**** did a rewrite
***** dualmap is more like deepmap
****** needs a code block as argument
***** dualmap-numerics
****** clone of my perl5 project Data::Math
******* presumes you're working on numeric leaf nodes
******* allows strings for operations ('+', '*', '-', '/')
******* default string handler does what *I* mean,
******** via OOP interface can use code block instead

** the maybe method (dot question mark operator: ".?")
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my $result = $obj.?method($arg, $arg);
#+END_SRC

*** jonathan worhthington mentions this (WTF)
