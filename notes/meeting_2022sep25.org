**** summary
***** 
#+BEGIN_SRC text
TASK #1: Unique Array

You are given list of arrayrefs. Write a script to remove the duplicate arrayrefs from the given list.

TASK #2: Date Difference

You are given two dates, $date1 and $date2 in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
Write a script to find the difference between the given dates in terms on years and days only.
#+END_SRC

*** another weekly challenge
**** longest common prefix in directory names
**** rob's code treats as strings, then ensures it stops at a '/'
**** the lcp code on rosettacode has problems: old style 2015
***** bruce gray makes point it doesn't stop when it's found divergence
****** instead of ords should use cars
****** no need for vertbar
****** should use eq not eqv
****** coming out of [\and] you'll see T, T, F, F, ...
****** use first to bail out when F found?

**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5040
**** if leon likes it, sokay with me
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my $success = // $result;
#+END_SRC

*** substr uses first_position and length
**** but I always want ranges: first_position, second_position
**** how would you raku that?
***** duh, use a range
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/substr
***** say substr("Long string", 3..6);     # OUTPUT: «g st␤» 
***** 
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my $str = 'godzilla';
$str.substr-rw(3,6) = '66666666';
say $str; # god66666666
#+END_SRC
***** bruce gray will report docs bug substr-rw
