*** substr uses first_position and length
**** but I always want ranges: first_position, second_position
**** how would you raku that?

*** revisit: "eurorack": william michels interested in synthesized music 
**** https://www.modulargrid.net/e/modules/evaluationlists



*** refactoring an old perl5 project
**** web photo gallery, static web page generation
***** write simple tests (only single photoseries case covered)
***** script code broken down into subs (done long ago)
***** move subs into library, rewrite scripts to use library code
****** exporter-based 
***** refactor subs so they stop shelling out so much, call the subs directly
****** exposes some odd bugs: scope of "memory" changes

***** code is getting gradually less ugly, *but*. 
****** harder to hack than it should be.
****** needs
******* real templates
******* database to track metadata

***** delaying the real fixes, adding additional hacks to reduce the need
****** e.g. codes embedded in file names that get turned to punctuation later

***** central problem: I want to roll my own, but no good reason to release
****** a thought: keep re-writing this in different ways, use it as a demo/test case

***** data modeling mistakes: 
****** attributing multiple photographers
****** photos of a subject from multiple sessions
****** untitled photos need html filenames too
******* you can have a series inside a series
******** e.g. three shots getting gradually closer

***** weird bitrot affecting jpeg orientations
