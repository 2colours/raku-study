** topics 
*** substr uses first_position and length
**** but I always want ranges: first_position, second_position
**** how would you raku that?

*** revisit: "eurorack": william michels interested in synthesized music 
**** https://www.modulargrid.net/e/modules/evaluationlists


*** refactoring an old perl5 project
**** web photo gallery, static web page generation
***** write simple tests (only single photoseries case covered)
***** script code broken down into subs (done long ago)
***** move subs into library, rewrite scripts to use library code
****** exporter-based 
***** refactor subs so they stop shelling out so much, call routines directly
****** exposes some odd bugs: code has more memory now

***** code is getting gradually less ugly, *but*.

***** delaying the real fixes, adding additional hacks to reduce the need
****** e.g. codes embedded in file names that get turned to punctuation later

***** 

***** central problem: I want to roll my own, but no good reason to release
****** a thought: keep re-writing this in different ways, use it as a demo/test case

***** weird bitrot affecting jpeg orientations

** announcements
