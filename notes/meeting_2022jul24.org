***** can do it with zero-width after/before matches
***** or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.

***** william michels turned up this on the subject:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63426361/raku-effect-of-capture-markers-is-lost-higher-up

**** the double-asterix non-flattening slurpy array signature

***** TODO investigate further, for next time
