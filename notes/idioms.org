* idioms
I'm looking for "recommended idioms", cases where there are
several ways of doing things in raku but one is favored.  
(The word "idiom" also gets used in a wider sense to just
mean "a way to do it", or "the Raku way of doing it".)

** blog posts
*** utilpm from 2011 (more of a "Raku way to do it" piece):
https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/day-23-idiomatic-perl-6/

*** gfldex from 2021, writing a wget in raku several different ways
https://gfldex.wordpress.com/2021/04/16/all-your-idioms-are-belong-to-us/

*** damien conway 2019, idioms for iterating over a list or doing something else if empty
http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/09/itchscratch.html

** from the docs
The docs uses the word "idiom" occasionally, though only sometimes indicating
a style preference:

*** assignment with method call
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
class LongClassName { 
     has $.frobnicate; 
 } 
 my LongClassName $bar .= new( frobnicate => 42 ); # no need to repeat class name 
#+END_SRC

*** using signals in an event driven situation:

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
react { 
     whenever signal(SIGINT) { 
         say "goodbye"; 
         done 
     } 
 } 
#+END_SRC

*** stringifying match object 
 $/.Str should also work, ~$/ is currently the more common idiom.

*** call named params in colon-style similar to declaration
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
sub speak(:$word, :$times) {
  say $word for ^$times
}
speak(word => 'hi', times => 2);
speak(:word<hi>, :times<2>);      # Alternative, more idiomatic

speak(:word(hi), :times(2));      # Maybe *more* idiomatic? (if it works)

#+END_SRC

*** usually drop optional parens 
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
 if ($a < 0) { ... }         # Perl 6 
 if $a < 0 { ... }           # Perl 6, more idiomatic 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
 while ($x > 5) { ... }      # Perl 6 
 while $x > 5 { ... }        # Perl 6, more idiomatic 
#+END_SRC


*** raku "or die" used much like perl
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
mkdir "newdir" or die "$!";   ## but now it dies anyway, so...
rmdir "newdir" or die "$!"; 
#+END_SRC

*** given/when
given sets $_ inside the following block. 
The keywords for individual cases are when and default. 

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my $var = (Any, 21, any <answer lie>).pick;
given $var {
    when 21 { say $_ * 2 }
    when 'lie' { .say }
    default { say 'default' }
}
#+END_SRC

*** looping over keys and values of a hash

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my %vowels = 'a' => 1, 'e' => 2, 'i' => 3, 'o' => 4, 'u' => 5;
for %vowels.kv -> $vowel, $index {
  "$vowel: $index".say;
}
#+END_SRC

*** use LEAVE phaser for closing the handles 
works regardless of how the block is left.
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
if $do-stuff-with-the-file { 
     my $fh = open "path-to-file"; 
     LEAVE close $fh; 
     # ... do stuff with the file 
 } 
#+END_SRC

*** the smartmatch operator ~~ rather than does
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my $d = Date.new('2016-06-03');
say $d.does(Dateish);       # True    (Date does role Dateish) 
say $d ~~ Dateish;          # True
#+END_SRC

Note: isa is like does, but returns True only for superclasses, 
does includes both superclasses and roles.

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
say $d.isa(Dateish);        # False
#+END_SRC
