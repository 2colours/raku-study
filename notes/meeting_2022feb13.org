** topics
*** fosdem
**** videos (note, the webm files have sound, but the mp4s don't)
***** https://video.fosdem.org/2022/
***** https://video.fosdem.org/2022/D.raku/
**** Some are on youtube (but none of the Raku ones)

*** unix.stackexchange.com moderator has magnanimously unbanned me

*** Physics::Measure
**** really "physical measurments":
***** numerics with error bars and units
**** Steve Roe, aka p6steve

**** github
***** https://raku.land/github:p6steve/Physics::Measure
***** https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Physics-Measure
***** https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Physics-Unit
***** https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Physics-Error
**** questions:
***** mentions error bars-- don't see an example (in Physics::Error)
****** links to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty
****** admits this is a complex subject, and his code is limited to the simplest approach: "linear".

***** comparison operators with error bars?  (works, but maybe not how you expect)
***** automatic unit conversion?  (yes!)
***** review recommended math with error bars.  rms or something?
***** how does it get units to work?  e.g. $l = 5 m; 
****** Here: "m" is a Raku postfix operator

*** william michels github issue
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4767 
***** @*ARGS to do what he wants
***** genuinely odd behavior: indexing [0] on a non-list is not an error
****** So Raku coerces the single value into a list, and derefs it?

*** Making a hash out of intertwined array of strings and integers
**** https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/skc52i/making_a_hash_out_of_intertwined_array_of_strings/

** untopics
*** Alan, noting my Materials Science background asks what I think of:
**** https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230510.The_New_Science_of_Strong_Materials
**** https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4615-9074-3

*** William Michels was curious about:
**** "R for Finite Element Analyses of Size-dependent Microscale Structures"
**** https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-7014-4

** announcements
