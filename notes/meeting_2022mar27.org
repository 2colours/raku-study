** later:
*** .trans allows regexs: how do ambiguous cases resolve?
**** longest token matching (tests for .trans are very good):
./S05-transliteration/trans.t

is('ababab'.trans([/ab/, 'aba', 'bab', /baba/] =>
                   ['1',  '2',   '3',   '4'   ]),
   '23',
   'longest token still holds, even between constant strings and regexes');
