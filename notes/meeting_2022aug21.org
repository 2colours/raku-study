*** the revenge of the son of the return of junction gotchas

***** Márton Polgár: junctions and negated operators (a bad raku trap)
****** negation with junctions goes outside the junction

****** really should be docummented on the traps page

.none %% 2 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
.all  !%% 2 
#+END_SRC

**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp
***** locally: /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/rakudo/gen/moar/Grammar.nqp
