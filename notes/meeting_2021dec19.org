*** david asks:
**** is there a raku macro system, like c preprocessor
***** "hygenic macros" still missing (as I remember)

***** no clue, haven't heard

*** sean mcaffee, div doesn't coerce to numeric?
**** https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2021/12/msg10343.html
**** maybe a feature: '3' => 3 is okay, but is 3.4 => 3?

*** idea for a new utility package

**** wants to name it "_" or "lowbar" 
***** because calling it "util" would be confusing
***** very specific rules for the package without any ideas of what to put in it
***** complicated thinking justifying the underlying philosophy, based on observations of programmer behavior
