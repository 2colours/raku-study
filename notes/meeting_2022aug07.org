* meeting notes August 07, 2022
** the raku study group
**** usual links
***** these notes
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/blob/main/notes/meeting_2022aug07.md
***** code examples
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2022aug07

** current topics
*** perl5 perl-porters: \U\L interpolation contructs don't work well together
**** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2022aug07/case_change_via_interpolation.pl
*** rob ransbottom:
**** a little thing: inadvertantly calling a method on $_, forgot the variable 
***** a raku drawback: that can't be a bug, because there's always a $_
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2022aug07rob_using_topic_vs_named_var.raku
**** and why did they do this: you can use container comparison with a single argument
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2022aug07container_comparison_op.raku
***** using notation infix:< ... >

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
say infix:<=:=>(42);    # True
#+END_SRC

**** some error messages refer to a signature: ($?)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
say  infix:<=:=>(Mu); 
 # Cannot resolve caller infix:<=:=>(Mu:U); none of these signatures match:
 #     ($?)
 #     (Mu \a, Mu \b)
#+END_SRC

***** lizmat explains the ? isn't a twigil, it indicates it's *optional*
***** but there are cases where the ? *is* a twigil (nasty source of confusion)
****** https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Compile-time_variables

***** Márton Polgár: junctions and negated operators (a bad raku trap)
****** negation with junctions goes outside the junction
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2022aug07/issue_with_negated_operators_and_junctions.raku
****** really should be docummented on the traps page
****** these aren't equivalent
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
.none %% 2 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
.all  !%% 2 
#+END_SRC

*** weekly challenge
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-176/#TASK1

** topics for next time

*** TODO raku for data science  (one for next time)
**** gradual types for gradually cleaning up data
**** https://p6steve.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/is-raku-dan-rubbersonic/

*** TODO william michels, corrupt json handling (maybe next week)
**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/706732/deleting-all-text-after-a-specific-string-for-multiple-text-files-in-a-directory/707180#707180

** earlier topics
*** regex feature: control what's captured with <( ... )>
***** <( isn't really equivalent to \K in a substitution
***** can do it with zero-width after/before matches
***** or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.

***** william michels turned up this on the subject:
