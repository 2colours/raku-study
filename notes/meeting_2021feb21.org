**** Simon Proctor module, sets from ranges
**** Richard Hainsworth reports issues with set identity (==) (can't repro)
*** project: write variants of set operations:

**** preserve order
**** maybe: avoid uniqifying
**** maybe: act on more complex structures
***** distinguish and preserve metadata
****** do-able (partially) with custom WHICH
****** what about numeric operations
