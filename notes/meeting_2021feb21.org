**** code example

**** related operations
| method  | description                      | key attributes  |
|---------+----------------------------------+-----------------|
| .unique | does a uniq                      | preserves order |
| .squish | fold together consecutive dupes  | preserves order |
| .Bag    | gets counts of repeated elements |                 |
**** Simon Proctor module, sets from ranges
https://github.com/Scimon/p6-Range-SetOps
**** Richard Hainsworth reports issues with set identity (==) (can't repro)
*** project: write variants of set operations:
**** act on *and return* arrays
***** a wrapper could remember what it was given 
**** preserve order
**** maybe: avoid uniqifying
**** maybe: act on more complex structures
***** distinguish and preserve metadata
****** do-able (partially) with custom WHICH
****** what about numeric operations
*** andrew shitov "Perl 6 at a Glance"

14:44:46	 From Bill Michels : "dot" is the traditional Graphviz renderer

*** Bruce Gray example of using GraphViz:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
digraph G {

  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=filled;
    color=lightgrey;
    node [style=filled,color=white];
    a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
    label = "process #1";
  }

  subgraph cluster_1 {
    node [style=filled];
    b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
    label = "process #2";
    color=blue
  }
  start -> a0;
  start -> b0;
  a1 -> b3;
  b2 -> a3;
  a3 -> a0;
  a3 -> end;
  b3 -> end;

  start [shape=Mdiamond];
  end [shape=Msquare];
}
#+END_SRC
