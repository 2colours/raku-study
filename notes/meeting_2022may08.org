**** code examples
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2022may08

** editorial: perl5-porters are in good shape, and backwards compatibility is a priority again
*** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31259332

** finished tests to examine ^methods issues 
**** https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast/tree/main/S12-introspection/method_object_gists.t

**** misc things could be said about the code (search for STUDYGROUP)
***** /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Notes/notes-darkroast-c
***** aret_methods_method

** TODO review introspection features
*** find all classes
*** can you know what traits were used
**** rob's;
raku -e '.say for (|CORE::, |UNIT::, |OUTERS::, |MY::).grep({ .key eq .value.^name }).grep({ .value.HOW.^name eq "Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW" }).map(*.key).unique' | sort | less
} 
**** bruce's:
raku -e 'say .value.HOW.^name, "\t", .key for (|CORE::, |UNIT::, |OUTERS::, |MY::).grep({ .key eq .value.^name })' | sort | less

*** more mysteries: 
**** can you get the ^methdods of a submethod?
***** "implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific"
**** can you look up the signature for a method object?
***** bruce gray:
raku -e 'my $n = 42; say .signature for $n.can("log")'
# (Int: |)
# (Cool: |) 


** raku's "move" considered ungood
*** move/copy command in Raku doesn't work with directory as second arg
*** https://docs.raku.org/routine/move
**** "To avoid copying, you can use rename, if the files are on the same storage device. It also works with directories, while move does not."
**** Uh: WTF?
*** we've discussed this one already:
***** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71909580/move-function-does-not-work-in-raku-in-windows/71973303#71973303
*** an issue: the unix "mv" can do a rename or a refile
**** unix mv: 
***** refile happens if last argument is a directory
***** rename fails if there are more than two arguments
**** Q: should raku emulate unix
***** unix-heads were target audience for perl, maybe not-so for raku

*** tried using "rename" here, found it did a *copy*, needed to manually unlink original

** sniping at perl, circa 2009

*** https://corky.net/dotan/log/2009/06/heres-why-people-hate-perl-folks.html 
**** William Michaels brought up this piece from 2009
**** true: "There are many wonderful modules in CPAN, but learning about them, learning to use them ... takes even more time"
**** eh: "People hate Perl for the same reason we love it-- because it makes us feel clever."
***** And people attacked perl so they could feel clever-- or at least pose as enlightened insiders.
