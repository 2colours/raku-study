**** bill michaels brought up this piece from 2009
**** true enough: "There are many wonderful modules in CPAN, but learning about them, learning to use them, finding out about their hidden corner-cases and unexpected behaviors takes even more time"
**** eh: "People hate Perl for the same reason we love it-- because it makes us feel clever."
