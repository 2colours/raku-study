 * richard hainsworth regex problem, matching pod6-like things
*** bin/richard_hainsworth_regex_problem.pl6
*** bin/richard_hainsworth_grammar.raku
**** yary hluchan contribution: grammar-based solution
** github setup: got a number of people added as collaborators.  Anyone else interested?
** basic regex feature '%'
*** like a join, matches a sequence of *this* separated by *those*
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
token head  { <head-word>+ % <[\ \t]>+ | '' }
#+END_SRC

** grammar token feature '~' 
*** indicate bracketing chars at the beginning of the token
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
token meta-quoted { '"' ~ '"' <inside-quotes>* }
#+END_SRC

** basics of match objects
*** objects within objects
*** dd doesn't dump *everything*
*** if a named capture matches multiple times, you extract the hits as a list

** future subjects:
*** grammars have rule and regexp as well as token
*** bruce gray points out a virtue of grammars is the grammar debugger

** news
*** slides for yary's recent talk at SV Perl "Raku: Optimize for Fun"
https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0rYAz1cfyzXNjGGYDfhS9dA1A#Raku-Optimize_for_Fun

** future subjects
*** list comprehension
**** grep, map, etc.
**** exists in raku, python-influenced
