 * richard hainsworth regex problem, matching pod6-like things
*** bin/richard_hainsworth_regex_problem.pl6
*** bin/richard_hainsworth_grammar.raku
** github setup: got a number of people added as collaborators
*** yary hluchan contributed his grammar solution to the rh prob
** basic regex feature '%'
*** like a join, matches a sequence of *this* separated by *those*

token head  { <head-word>+ % <[\ \t]>+ | '' }
** grammar token feature '~' to indicate bracketing chars at the beginning

	token meta-quoted { '"' ~ '"' <inside-quotes>* }
** basics of match objects
*** dd doesn't dump *everything*
*** if a named capture matches multiple times, you extract the hits as a list
** future subjects:
*** grammars have rule and regexp as well as token
*** bruce gray points out a virtue of grammars is the grammar debugger
