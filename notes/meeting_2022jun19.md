### topics

1.  regex feature: control what's captured with <( &#x2026; )>

    1.  from an old question in my notes:
    
        1.  Q: what's the Raku equivalent for p5's \K?
    
    2.  <( isn't really equivalent to <(
    
    3.  can do it with zero-width after/before matches
    
    4.  or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.
    
        1.  TODO try a variant without a named pattern ala quoted: what if it's embedded?

2.  rob ramsbottom

    1.  relating to the community
    
        1.  initiating pull requests and so on
        
        2.  rob opened a github issue, no action:

            2.  TODO add some comments, at the very least confirm the behavior.

            1.  I have a file that got dates from 01/01/2020 to 04/04/2021 I want to get only the dates between 01/03/2020 to 01/03/2021 by using egrep. I tried to do
            
                1.  raku -ne 'my $ts = .subst(/ ^ (\d*\*2) \\/ (\d*\*2) \\/ (\d*\*4) /, {"$2-$1-$0"}).Date; say $ts if Date.new("2020-03-01") < $ts < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file
                
                2.  raku -ne '.say if Date.new("2020-03-01") < S/ ^ (\d*\*2) \\/ (\d*\*2) \\/ (\d*\*4) *{"$2-$1-$0"}*.Date < Date.new("2021-03-01");' file

### from the last meeting notes

1.  continuing adventures with move/copy/rename

    1.  roast test checks whether the old file name is gone after rename
    
        1.  roast/S32-io/rename.t
    
    2.  I found I needed to unlink the old after a rename
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022mar13/tagger.raku>
    
    3.  how can you resolve that contradiction?
    
        1.  try this: roast test uses temp files in current directory
        
            1.  /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/darkroast/S32-io/rename.t
            
            2.  eventually will be out: <https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast>
    
    4.  some basics
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022jun05/trial-mkdir.raku>
