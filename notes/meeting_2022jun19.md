### from the last meeting notes

1.  continuing adventures with move/copy/rename

    1.  roast test checks whether the old file name is gone after rename
    
        1.  roast/S32-io/rename.t
    
    2.  I found I needed to unlink the old after a rename
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022mar13/tagger.raku>
    
    3.  how can you resolve that contradiction?
    
        1.  try this: roast test uses temp files in current directory
        
            1.  /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/darkroast/S32-io/rename.t

    4.  some basics
