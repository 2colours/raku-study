** stuff it all in to the great stuffiness
*** data-handling in raku 
**** talked about three rough approaches
***** perl-style: arrays of hashes, hashes as records
***** raku: data container objects more practical
***** rlang-style: columns of data, aggregate methods appropriate for type

**** note: i'm agnostic on strong typing
***** some type checking good, large amounts may just be redundant
***** testing can stubstitute for strong-types, but not vice-versa

**** bruce gray demoed some techniques
