*** lightning talk in-progress: given-when vs multi-dispatch
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/01-the_given_when_case.raku
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/02-the_multi_dispatch_case.raku
***** notice: order matters with given-when, with multidispatch it's specificity
****** given-when is straight-forward to think about
****** multi-dispatch has OOP flexibility
****** benchmark: with repetition argument running with "time"
******* results vary tremendously, no clear winner
****** multi with overlapping subsets: 
******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/multi_dispatch_with_overlapping_subset_types.raku
******** tie breaking:
********* I figured you'd need "is default"-- instead it goes by order-of-definition (NOT DOCUMENTED)
********* "is default" actually only works for two alternatives, with three you'd be SOL
********* brad gilbert argues it has to be this way for performance reasons
******** bruce gray tried some variants... 
********* variables of type Hero/Monster
********* Hero/Monster classes
