## multiple dispatch

Larry Wall on Raku:

"We don't actually have types for the benefit of strong typing. That's third place. Second place is we can optimize better. But first place is actually it's there for multiple dispatch."

&#x2013; Erlang & Elixir Factory, 2017

Douglas Crockford:

"But it turns out that strong typing does not eliminate the need for careful testing. And I have found in my work that the sorts of errors that strong type checking finds are not the errors I worry about."

&#x2013; "Javascript: The Good Parts" (2008)
