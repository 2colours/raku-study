### topics

1.  perl

    1.  perl 5.36 is out, showing some nice progress
    
        1.  features:
        
            1.  basic sub sigs, no longer "experimental"
            
            2.  more flexible for loops, getting more raku-ish
        
        2.  the psc has clarified they're committed to backwards compatibility (within reason)
        
        3.  no published criteria for when they'll declare "Perl 7"
        
            1.  I'm pretty sure it's waiting on Corina
            
            2.  (ovid's guess is that could be a few years)

2.  continuing adventures with move/copy/rename

    1.  roast test checks whether the old file name is gone after rename
    
        1.  roast/S32-io/rename.t
    
    2.  I found I needed to unlink the old after a rename
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022mar13/tagger.raku>
    
    3.  how can you resolve that contradiction?
    
        1.  try this: roast test uses temp files in current directory
    
    4.  some basics
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/bin/2022jun05/trial-mkdir.raku>

3.  my intro to raku spiels need work: hyperoperators, junctions, etc.

4.  recent weekly challenges that weren't number theory trivia for once

    1.  Task 1: Hexadecimal Words; Task 2: K-Directory Diff
    
        1.  <https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-166/>
        
        2.  arne sommers
        
            1.  <https://raku-musings.com/hexa-diff.html>
