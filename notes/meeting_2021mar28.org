**** narrow down what was wrong with moritz lenz inifile
***** /home/doom/End/Cave/Perl6/Wall/raku-study/bin/2021mar21/ini_file_parsing_with_moritz_lenz_grammar.raku
*** grammar to parse doomfiles
**** simple scripts, e.g. scan through browse sequence

bruce gray shows us some rosettacode working with 
lazy lists to get a list of primes with monotonically 
increasing differences: 

http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Next_special_primes#Raku


destructured syntax:

sub is-special ( ($previous, $gap) ) {

sub requires a list of two elements, unpacked by convenience
into those names.  (Bet I can use this instead of $pair)
