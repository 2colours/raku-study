* meeting notes Mar 28, 2021
** topics
*** news: perl foundation project to improve raku docs
**** https://perl-foundation-outreach.github.io/season-of-docs-ideas/docs.html
***** some of the ideas include documenting exceptions and traits better
***** they're looking for suggestions for big things to fix (not our usual bug reports to JJ)
*** extracting results from grammar matches
**** alternate example, works
/home/doom/End/Cave/Perl6/Wall/raku-study/bin/2021mar21/ini_file_parsing_with_zoffix_grammar.raku
***** from zoffix talk july 28, 2018 intro p6 regexes and grammars
****** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmFAPvssrk

**** narrow down what was wrong with moritz lenz inifile
***** /home/doom/End/Cave/Perl6/Wall/raku-study/bin/2021mar21/ini_file_parsing_with_moritz_lenz_grammar.raku
****** bruce gray sorted it out: Needed a $/.<value> to deref, *not* $/.value
******* bad gotcha: the .value method is there for the grammar to work
******** if I understand right: calling it restarts part of the grammar matching
*** grammar to parse doomfiles
**** simple scripts, e.g. scan through browse sequence (done)
***** a number of issues: 
****** bad efficiency bug (Mohrvm panic!) 
fixed by changing   stuff regex (.*?) to non-greedy (.*)

*** getting a list of primes with monotonically increasing differences
**** bruce gray shows us some lazy list trickery up at rosettacode now
***** http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Next_special_primes#Raku

*** sub with "destructuring" syntax:

#+BEGIN_SRC perl6-mode
sub is-special ( ($previous, $gap) ) {
#+END_SRC

sub takes a list of two elements, unpacked into the two named variables.  

(Better than my usual dodge of passing a $pair variable-- 
which isn't a Pair.) 

*** the .first method 
william michels was interested in some lizmat examples from irc
