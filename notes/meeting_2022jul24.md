### regex feature: control what's captured with <( &#x2026; )>

1.  <( isn't really equivalent to \K in a substitution

2.  can do it with zero-width after/before matches

3.  or by having multiple ordered captures, etc.

4.  william michels turned up this on the subject:

    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63426361/raku-effect-of-capture-markers-is-lost-higher-up>

1.  the double-asterix non-flattening slurpy array signature

    1.  so the single asterix is flattening?
    
    2.  TODO investigate further, for next time

2.  rob ramsbottom

    1.  rob opened a github issue, no action:
    
        1.  <https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4945>
        
        2.  TODO add some comments, at the very least confirm the behavior.
