*** nano-lightning talk: given-when vs multi-dispatch
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/01-the_given_when_case.raku
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/02-the_multi_dispatch_case.raku
***** notice: order matters with given-when, with multidispatch it's specificity
****** given-when is straight-forward to think about
****** multi-dispatch has OOP flexibility
****** TODO benchmark: add a repetition argument, run with "time" 
****** multi with overlapping subsets supposed to need 'is default' to break tie
******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/multi_dispatch_with_overlapping_subset_types.raku
******* note: "default" means something different in the two approaches
