**** some other material:
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/raku-study/notes/talks/multidispatch_vs_case
**** note: order matters with given-when, with multidispatch it's specificity
***** given-when is straight-forward to think about
***** multi-dispatch has OOP flexibility
***** benchmark: with repetition argument running with "time"
****** results vary tremendously, no clear winner
***** multi with overlapping subsets: 
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/multi_dispatch_with_overlapping_subset_types.raku
******* tie breaking:
******** I figured you'd need "is default"-- instead it goes by order-of-definition (NOT DOCUMENTED)
******** "is default" actually only works for two alternatives, with three you'd be SOL
******** brad gilbert argues it has to be this way for performance reasons
******** most recent brad gilbert post (factorial) example is puzzling
******** https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2021/09/msg10149.html
********* doesn't seem to address the issue at hand
********* some idioms in use are interesting:
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
multi factorial ( 0 --> 1 ){}
multi factorial ( 1 --> 1 ){}
multi factorial ( UInt \n ){ factorial(n - 1) * n }

say factorial( 1 );
# ERROR: both UInt and 1 subsets match.
#+END_SRC
********* Signature matches on single value 0, and restricts return to single value 1
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
multi factorial ( 0 --> 1 ){}
#+END_SRC
********** Alternately, the "returns" keyword

*********** https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#Return_type_constraints

******* bruce gray tried some variants:
******** variables of type Hero/Monster
******** Hero/Monster classes

***** https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3966
***** https://design.raku.org/S02.html#Twigils
**** the term twigil appears to be a larry wall invention
***** not many web hits
***** one dictionary site refers to perl
****** "Twigil meaning (computing, programming, Perl language) A character prepended to a variable name to indicate its scope."
******* (not actually a good definition)
**** my sense: twigil "tweaks" the meaning of the sigil
**** william michels associates "twigil" with "twin", indicating "two"
**** https://docs.raku.org/language/variables
**** https://design.raku.org/S02.html#Twigils
***** "Oddly scoped variables include a secondary sigil (a twigil) that indicates what kind of strange scoping the variable is subject to... ."
***** my reading: secondary sigil == a twigil
**** https://raku.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A02.html
***** RFC 133
***** larry wall: "[Update: Nowadays we call those funny characters sigils. And for weirdly scoped variables there's a second character called a twigil.]"
