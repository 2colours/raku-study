### nano-lightning talk: given-when vs multi-dispatch

2.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/02-the_multi_dispatch_case.raku>

3.  some other material:

    1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/raku-study/notes/talks/multidispatch_vs_case>

4.  note: order matters with given-when, with multidispatch it's specificity

    1.  given-when is straight-forward to think about
    
    2.  multi-dispatch has OOP flexibility
    
    3.  benchmark: with repetition argument running with "time"
    
        1.  results vary tremendously, no clear winner
    
    4.  multi with overlapping subsets:
    
        1.  <https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021sep26/multi_dispatch_with_overlapping_subset_types.raku>
        
            1.  tie breaking:
            
                1.  I figured you'd need "is default"&#x2013; instead it goes by order-of-definition (NOT DOCUMENTED)
                
                2.  "is default" actually only works for two alternatives, with three you'd be SOL
                
                3.  brad gilbert argues it has to be this way for performance reasons
                
                4.  most recent brad gilbert post (factorial) example is puzzling
                
                5.  <https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2021/09/msg10149.html>
                
                    1.  doesn't seem to address the issue at hand
                    
                    2.  some idioms in use are interesting:
                    
                        ```perl6
                        multi factorial ( 0 --> 1 ){}
                        multi factorial ( 1 --> 1 ){}
                        multi factorial ( UInt \n ){ factorial(n - 1) * n }
                        
                        say factorial( 1 );
                        # ERROR: both UInt and 1 subsets match.
                        ```
                    
                    3.  Signature matches on single value 0, and restricts return to single value 1
                    
                        ```perl6
                        multi factorial ( 0 --> 1 ){}
                        ```
            
            2.  bruce gray tried some variants&#x2026;
            
                1.  variables of type Hero/Monster
                
                2.  Hero/Monster classes

### definition of "twigil"

1.  the second char, or the two char pair

    1.  survey says "second char"
    
        1.  textual support in early writings of the larry
        
        2.  William Michels took the minority side,
        
            1.  has a reading of his own of some of the material
        
        3.  JJ offers a bit of limited support:
        
            "TBH, I understood the same as @jubilatious1."; "Obviously, we have to stick to the published definition."

2.  background

    1.  <https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3965#issuecomment-924405557>
    
    2.  <https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/3965#issue-1003135309>
    
    3.  <https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3966>
    
    4.  <https://design.raku.org/S02.html#Twigils>

3.  the term twigil appears to be a larry wall invention

    1.  not many web hits
    
    2.  one dictionary site refers to perl
    
        1.  "Twigil meaning (computing, programming, Perl language) A character prepended to a variable name to indicate its scope."
        
            1.  (not actually a good definition)

4.  my sense: twigil "tweaks" the meaning of the sigil

5.  william michels associates "twigil" with "twin", indicating "two"

6.  <https://docs.raku.org/language/variables>

7.  <https://design.raku.org/S02.html#Twigils>

    1.  "Oddly scoped variables include a secondary sigil (a twigil) that indicates what kind of strange scoping the variable is subject to&#x2026; ."
    
    2.  my reading: secondary sigil == a twigil

8.  <https://raku.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A02.html>

    1.  RFC 133
    
    2.  larry wall: "[Update: Nowadays we call those funny characters sigils. And for weirdly scoped variables there's a second character called a twigil.]"
