** possible topics
*** in raku, data objects are faster than hashes (a lizmat point)
*** classes vs prototypes: toddandmargo vs ralph mellor
https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2021/02/msg9706.html
*** sets/bags/mixes 
**** could use a general name.  Larry Wall called them QuantHashes
**** some Set methods
***** elems
***** grab
***** grabpairs
***** maxpairs
***** minpairs
***** pick
weighted random pick
***** pickpairs
***** of
***** roll
like pick, but can use with Mix too (pick not a Mix method, eh?)
**** convenience issues
I rate convenience over performance on these features.
Why doesn't this work?
Why is error message so LTA?
#+BEGIN_SRC perl6
my $result = set @monster2  (-) set @monsters1;
# Variable '@monster2' is not declared.  Did you mean any of these:
# '@monsters2', '@monsters1'?
#+END_SRC
