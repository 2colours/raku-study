# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

As the organizer of the San Francisco Perl Group, I started a Raku
Study Group a few years back.  When we needed a place to share some of the exploratory code 
we've been generating, I created this github project. 

The SF Perl Raku study group began life as an in-person meeting
(usually over at the Oakland Museum's Cafe), but recently we've
moved to an on-line format (typically via zoom), attracting some 
attendees from around the world in the process.
