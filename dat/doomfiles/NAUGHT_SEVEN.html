For no good reason: continue listing
the books I've read in 2007.                        <A HREF="FIFTY_IN_ONE.html">FIFTY_IN_ONE</A>

But I'm starting the year late:
I still need to finish some of
my 2006 books.                       (I've always liked
                                     taking Incompletes.)

  1. Ian Fleming  -- Moonraker     (rr)

  2. The Big Broadcast  (skim)       <A HREF="THE_VOICE_OF_DOOM.html">THE_VOICE_OF_DOOM</A>

  3. J.G. Ballard -- Terminal Beach (1964)

     At long last, I've read some Ballard.
     I've only had this book on my stacks
     for three decades or so...

     I don't think any of the stories
     in this collection actually qualifies                   UTOPIA
     as a "story" in the taxonomy that I
     favor: problems are not solved,           This, you see makes it
     conflicts are not resolved... instead     more *realistice*:
     what we have here is a steady parade      except that it isn't
     of losers in the act of losing.           particularly.

        So call them "tragedies",                 Consider the title story
        if you like -- I don't think              "Terminal Beach", where
        that really works, but it                 (1) it's actually rather
        gets across the tone.                     remarkable that the the
                                                  main character has
        In the absence of worms-turned,           somehow arrived on the
        and villains vanquished, we               scene and (2) he proceeds
        have some astoundingly                    to have many interesting,
        well-crafted vignettes with               albeit deranged, thoughts
        really tight sketches of                  while starving to death --
        character and place.  These               myself, I doubt that I
        are so slickly done that they             could pull this off
        don't even seem slick.                    without any fuel to burn.

           Direct comparison to some lesser
           writing is probably needed to
           really appreciate this --
           many a more popular author can
           spend paragraphs on "description"
           and not pull off the sense of
           place a Ballard does with just
           a few lines.

  4. "The Rivals of Shelock Holmes Vol. 1"

         As is common with anything
         revered, you occasionally hear
         someone taking the line
         "Holmes is over-rated".                  <A HREF="THE_CASE_OF_HOLMES.html">THE_CASE_OF_HOLMES</A>

         Before you go there, I suggest
         you take a look at Doyle's
         contemporaries and competitors.
         Some of these stories are
         reasonably engaging -- most
         aren't -- but few of them show
         the barest glimmer of Getting
         the Idea.

             "Crime is common, but logic is rare":

                 I think Doyle was using
                 Holmes to complain about
                 someone besides Watson.

 13. Ross MacDonald -- "The Barbarous Coast" (1956)

 14. Cecelia Holland -- "Railroad Schemes" (1997)

     Teenage girl protagonist (sneer
     not at the "young adult" market,
     it's a living), in the old west,
     gets involved with a gunfighter
     dude and various machinations
     involving ripping off the
     railroad companies -- who are
     such serious bastards, that they
     deserve little sympathy for
     being robbed.

     Cecelia Holland does her ususal magic,
     making "the past come alive" with
     an incredible economy of words.

        I particularly liked the
        detail about Virginia City:
        the ground under the city so
        riddled with mining operations
        that the city always vibrates and
        rumbles slightly.

  18. Ross MacDonald -- "Find a Victim"  (1953)

             A readable book that moves
             along well, with half-way
             plausible tough-guy detective
             schtick, and a mystery with
             a largely logical solution...

                Still, something

                prefunctory --

  20. Carter Dickson -- "And So to Murder" (rr)

      In this tale, a young and naive authoress has
      scored a hit with a bodice-ripper titled
      "Desire". A running joke: no one can believe
      this innocent young woman wrote the book.

      She goes off to work in the British film
      industry, circa 1938-39, and meets a
      detective story writer, of whom she'd
      conceived an intense dislike from a
      distance.  By story's end, the dislike      This bears some
      transforms itself into the usual.           resemblence to the
                                                  opening of "The Case of

         Entertaining.  Works much
         better than it has a right to.

  21. The Wire, June 2007 (~20,000 words)

      I decided to plow through a single issue of this
      intimidating monthly, giving it a close reading.

  22. John Dickson Carr -- "Poison in Jest" (1932)  (rr)

         An odd one for Carr... not one of his
         two big detectives, it isn't even his
         third big one (the Bencolin he started
         writing about). Instead he takes
         Bencolin's Watson ("Jeff Marle"), moves
         him across the pond to Carr's home town
         of Philadelphia, and (eventually, a good
         third of the way through the book)
         introduces a new detective for him:
         Rossiter, a burbling British space
         cadet, all Bertie Wooster on the surface,
         with a touch of Whimsey underneath.

         This Rossiter schtick isn't too bad --
         it's much like what Carr was to continue
         to do with his Dr. Fell -- but nothing
         else about this book is worth much.
         I've heard it's depiction of atmosphere
         praised, but to me it's a bad joke -- a        By S.T. Joshi...
         bunch of jittery, irritating people who
         jump and scream every time a door slams.          <A HREF="JUST_JOSHI.html>JUST_JOSHI</A>

                One oddity about it is that it's
                essentially Psychological, and yet
                there's a passage where Carr sneers
                at psychologists...

            I suspect what's going on here is
            that Carr was working too close to
            home at this point... the focus of
            the book is a guy of his father's
            generation -- possibly he's even            This is yet another
            modeled on his father -- and the            trap with the
            location is the area Carr was born          "write what you
            (not his beloved, adopted England).         know" line... for
                                                        some authors that's
                                                        a guaranteed ticket
                                                        to tedium.

                                             of the setting, or explaining
                                             the roots of a character's
                                             quirk in their personal history.



  23. Maxwell Grant -- "The Five Chameleons" (1932)

       A very weak, relatively dull
       "Shadow" novel.  The first
       third or so of it is full of        The Shadow's sanctum
       some heavy-handed narration         is described in some
       that's unfortunately                detail, down to the

                                                    place it's introduced?
   It has it's moments, perhaps, but very few:

   in a low, even monotone.  "I cannot change          the "hands gliding

   alter the future."                                  schtick, manipulating

  25. Maxwell Grant -- "The Black Hush" (1933)

        Yet another.  A little less

        "Five Chameleons", with
        writing that's a *little*      Lamont Cranston is on stage,

               that he could've literally used    blackouts using
               to get a line on the problem,      their super-science
               and instead he magically gets      ray gun from some
               the "solution" using some other    central location in
               information that realistically     mid-town Manhatten,
               probably wouldn't have helped      so he begins
               that much.                         marking sites of
                                                  blackouts on a map.

                                                        He begins drawing
                                                        lines from these
                                                        points... without
                                                        anything to fix
                                                        a direction.

                                                        The one case where
                                                        he has two locations
                                                        blacked out at the

                                                        redundant-- but that's
                                                        the one case that
                                                        can show the line of

   26.  "The Avenger #1: Justice, Inc" (1939)
        nominally by Kenneth Robeson,                (Steranko says 1936,
        ghosted by Paul Ernst (according              apparently in error)
        to Jim Steranko)

              Since these were not
              actually written by Lester
              Dent (the author of the Doc
              Savage stories), I wondered
              if this one might be a
              little better written.

              I'd have to say that Paul Ernst
              has a slightly better feel for
              character than Dent (it would       Even the dour-Scotsman
              be impossible to have worse).       guy is better realized
                                                  than any of the Savage
                 This story is clearly an         gang.
                 attempt at "doing another
                 Doc Savage" without
                 getting too close to the
                 original.  The rule of                 <A HREF="ANASTRUCTING.html">ANASTRUCTING</A>
                 reversals is generously
                 applied: Savage was a
                 giant among men, so
                 Benson "The Avenger" is
                 a wiry 5'8".  Doc was a
                 "man of bronze", so
                 Benson is a "grey fox"
                 with blue eyes and
                 prematurely white hair.


                         By the way: "Justice, Inc"
                         is about a stock take-over
                         scam, and "The Five
                         Chameleons" was about a
                         scheme for covering runs on    Ah, the thirties... if
                         a bank with counterfeit.       only we could return to
                                                        that innocent time...


  27.  brian d foy  -- "Mastering Perl" (2007)

     Not precisely about "mastering" perl --
     this is more of a grab bag of things
     you should know about that haven't
     been written about much elsewhere.

       e.g. he doesn't talk much about
       using the standard perl debugger,
       because that's the focus of "Pro Perl
       Debugging" -- instead he talks about
       alternate debuggers (e.g. pktkdb),
       and makes the point that you can write
       your own if you like...

       Some nice stuff scattered around here
       and there.  For example, I hadn't
       heard about DBI::Profile, which is
       almost exactly what I need at the moment.


  28.  Maxwell Grant -- "The Grove of Doom" (1933)

         The Shadow/Lamont Cranston, skulking
         about keeping an eye on an insane
         inheritence dispute, where different       Suspense is generated
         factions have brought in mobsters and      by using a female pov
         a mysterious menace imported from          that doesn't know anything,

                                                    which is a slight flaw
                                                    as far as story-telling
                                                    is concerned.

                                                       (Is including

  30. Grant Morrison -- "Soldiers Seven"

  A long series of around 30 comics.


  Lots of details, but precious      (Lengthy enough to count as
  little of it adds up to much.      a book, but I don't know
                                     that it was substantive
                                     enough...  Should I drop
                                     this from the list?)


  Some of the better details
  are the notions that in a
  world of "real superheros":

  (1) there would be rampant
      superhero sex-fetishes       But... that's already
                                   the case, in the nominally
                                   real world.

                                      American comics conventions,
                                      Japanese "cosplay"...

                                      It's one of the things that
                                      comics have always been about --
                                      freaks in strange, tight,
                                      brightly colored clothing,
                                      showing off idealized and
                                      exaggerated physical forms.


  (2) hospitals would be innundated with
      people doing stupid things to try
      to become superheroes (radiation
      exposure, animal bites, etc.)


I find it irritating that
it messes with "the New
Gods" material without
anything like Jack Kirby's
flair.

   The temptation for the
   fan is to try to infer
   rules from these cases:

   "No one should write
    that character except
    the creator!"

   But the New Gods series
   was, among other things,
   Kirby breathing life            <A HREF="THE_SOURCE.html">THE_SOURCE</A>
   into "Jimmy Olsen".



  31. John Dickson Carr -- "The Sleeping Sphinx" (1947) (rr)

  Not a bad initial set-up -- though to
  describe it is no doubt, to induce
  ironic eye-rolling: long-lost MI5 man
  returns, long presumed dead because of a      Our hero, the MI5 man
  story put out when he went undercover;        retreats into the
  the woman he'd put on hold has really been    Watson role when it's
  waiting for him all these years, though       time to bring Fell on
  there's little reason to expect this; he      stage... this sort of
  walks into a strange case of what may be      thing really is a
  murder or suicide; things look bad for        dramatic flaw, no
  his beloved (is she insane?) because --       matter how useful the
                                                author may find it in
     Because when you come down to              regulating the flow of
     it, she's been behaving in a               information to the
     perfectly insane way; Carr once            reader.
     again does a very energetic job
     of arm-flapping and hand-waving               Minor oddity:
     to distract from the problem,                 This edition mispells
     but this time it's much too big.              "MI5" as "M15".

                                                      (MI = "Military
                                                      Intelligence".)

      Many allusions are made
      to historical crime cases,
      though there are no direct
      literary references, except
      for one footnote:

  33. Michael McClure -- "Fragments of Perseus" (1983)

      Slim volume of poetry by one
      of the lesser known "beats".                Well somewhat lesser
                                                  known.  He *was* at

      The choices made in formatting are          "Howl".
      mildly irritating (all lines
      centered, with lots of use of
      capitals and repetition for
      emphasis), but then I gather that
      many of these are more intended to
      be performed than read.. and the
      "ecstatic voice" is used almost
      exclusively throughout -- perhaps
      the "beatest" thing here.

      But still, there are interesting phrases
      here and there -- paradoxical statements
      that just might be seeds of wisdom --

      And what largely interests me about McClure:

      Unlike many a poet, McClure does not turn
      his nose up at scientific understanding,
      rather he tries to embrace it, he does
      riffs off of it, as in the concluding poem,
      which leads off with a Lynn Margulis quote.

  35. Maxwell Grant -- "Chain of Death" (1934)

       Genuinely a bad book by any
       standard, not just because
       it's a member of the dubious
       class of "pulp fiction".

          Walter Gibson seems to have
          been going through a bad         <A HREF="GRANTS_TOMB.html">GRANTS_TOMB</A>
          stretch around then.

             One chapter goes through
             the solution of a simple
             cipher in detail.

             On the one hand, an "aside" like this
             is often more interesting than the
             "main story" -- it can be the thing
             that makes it work --

             But Poe did this already, didn't he?
             Not to mention Doyle?


  36. Maxwell Grant -- "Crime Circus" (1934)

      While not exactly a great book by any
      stretch, there's a huge difference in
      quality between this and the previous
      Shadow novels.

         There are comparatively few clumsy
         howlers in the writing, though there
         are still some:

             "LIKE other hardened rogues of scumland,
              Dombo knew the menace of The Shadow."       Weirdly enough,
                                                          mid-way through
         There doesn't seem to be anything                the dialog falls
         particularly crazy about the plot...             apart.  People
         we're back to skulking around in                 start speaking in
         dive bars eavesropping on gruff                  unnatural ways,
         gangsters, and so on.                            as though they
                                                          were doing a
         Featured asides: a                               radio show where

           as the Shadow.                                       film.

                (This "man of mystery" is well
                known enough for a third-rate
                clown to expect a visual parody
                will go over, and out in the
                sticks at that.)

                                  There's barely any mention of "Lamont
                                  Cranston" in this one, though all of the
                                  other regular characters (or more
                                  accurately, regular names) are on stage...
                                  Joe Cardonna, Vic Marquette and two
                                  leading members of the Shadow's gang
                                  (non-gang?  anti-gang-gang?): Clifford
                                  Marsland and Harry Vincent, with the usual
                                  cameo from Burbank.

         Note: nicotine was
         clearly widely
         known to be very          A side show act:
         addictive, as of 1934.    Cleed the chain-smoking
                                   "cigarette fiend".

            Recently I've been listening to
            some radio ads for cigarettes
            from 1951-- they place so much
            emphasis on being "smooth" and
            "mild" (our cigarette is the
            choice of actors, doctors, etc)
            that I infer they were already
            afraid of a cancer scare.

   Yes, Gibson's writing is definitely on form in this one:

      "Burning eyes blazed from beneath a
      blackened slouch hat. The mouths of
      mammoth automatics loomed like
      tunnels that boded death. Silent,
      The Shadow had risen from the
      dark. The master of vengeance had
      arrived to conquer crime!"

   Now that's Quality, as anyone can see.
   (You *can* see it, right?)


                                      "Evil schemes had ended.
                                      Minions of crime had died.
                                      Their insidious leader had
                                      perished. Justice had
                                      gained the victory over
                                      cross-purposes of crime.

   37. Bertrand Russell -- many and various    (inc?)


       Having just read Chomsky's tribute
       to Russell, I started reading through
       various essays of his, some from a          I offer this up
       volume of his "Basic Writings", others      as one of many
       from online "gutenberg press" editions,     reasons that this
       and so on.                                  notion of having
                                                   a quota on reading
       I was wondering about                       books is a little
       Russell's political ideas:,                 crazy.
       like many people back then,
       Russell was convinced of the                  Building your own
       harmfulness of "selfishness",                 anthology of
       and was dreaming of ways the                  selected works
       world could move beyond it.                   doesn't count?

       These days, we all tend to sneer              It has to be
       at the unrealistic idealism of                bound into a
       this sort of thing, and wonder                volume (real
       how all these socialist types                 or virtual)
       could've missed the problem of                by someone
       incentives for so long...                     else's hand.

           One of my first thoughts:
           Could it be that they hadn't                 Another example:
           *missed* the problem, but they               I've gotten interested
           had thought they had it solved?              in dueling pundits
           That democratic institutions                 of late: Paul
           were adequate to select                      Krugman vs. David
           wise and well-intentioned                    Kennedy, Peter
           leaders?                                     Bainhart (( sp?)),
                                                        etc.  By word count,
              It could be, for example,                 I'm sure this
              that the reason it seems                  would be another book.
              "unrealistic" to us is
              that we ourselves have
              slid too far to see a
              way through -- perhaps
              democracy was working
              better back then than now?       But no... there really
                                               does seem to be this
                                               odd blindspot.

    The "Basic Works" includes a few of           A lack of appreciation
    Russell's essays on John Dewey's              of the difficulties
    metaphysics -- and I found myself             of "mechanism design"..
    wondering if perhaps Russell hadn't
    missed the point.  It's full of a
    kind of rigorous logical reasoning
    can have a kind of smart-alecky
    quality to it-- you need to temper
    it with the knowledge that logical
    rigor doesn't really go anywhere
    either.

       Not when you're working with things
       without rigorous definition-- which
       is the case for anything we really
       care about.

  41. Carter Dickson -- "A Graveyard to Let" (1949)  (rr)

      I've got nothing to say about this one
      really, but allow me to make some
      remarks for my own future reference (the
      titles are often arbitrary sales labels
      on these things):

      H.M. plays some silly tricks in the New
      York subway (triggering an unlikely riot).
      A older, staid fellow stages a flamboyant     Exceedingly minor:
      disappearing act for no good reason.          Carr was probably

      pitcher (what?) -- and nearby there's a       flaps his arms and
      disused graveyard, with a tomb used as a      waves his hands
      hideout, where a victim of a murderous        astoundingly well,
      attack is found on the steps.                 given this weak
                                                    material.


  42. Emile Gaboriau -- "Monsieru Lecoq" (1880)

      I understood Gaboriau's Lecoq stories
      were supposed to have been an influence on
      Conan Doyle's invention of Holmes--

      John Dickson Carr quotes a note from Doyle's
      private journal remarking approvingly on two
      Gaboriau books: "like Wilkie Collins, only
      more so".

      It's remarkable how strong the influence
      is... at the outset we have Lecoq performing
      amazing feats of inference, to the amazement
      of his partner, an older simple-minded fellow
      nicknamed "Father Absinthe".

      Later in the book, he tests his talents in
      disguise by talking to one of his colleagues
      for 20 minutes, and then revealing that it is
      really himself, under the makeup.

      And I must say, it's a nice change for once
      to read one of the historically significant
      works of popular fiction and actually enjoy
      reading it for once.  The young Lecoq's
      trials and tribulations as he tries to
      establish himself as a police detective
      are actually reasonably engaging.  There
      are some logical lapses here and there
      perhaps, but none of the usual howlers.

      The ending is actually really interesting...
      Lecoq realizes that the villain of the
      story is too highly placed for him to touch
      as of yet, and vows to bide his time and conceal
      what he knows until someday maybe he can
      do something about it.

  45. John D. MacDonald --
      "The Girl in the Plain-Brown Wrapper" (rr)
      (1969)

      On this reading, it strikes me
      that these books are all really
      attempts at pushing past the                <A HREF="DEEP_BLUE.html">DEEP_BLUE</A>
      mind-body dichotomy.

      Hence the recurrent
      theme of human
      feeling vs animal
      lust; the repeated
      insistance that                     Lots of not terribly profound,
      human death really                  not terribly sophisticated
      *means* something...                attempts at being profound
                                          and sophisticated...
           And then there's the
           solution to the mystery --            But if you need to hear

           the up-coming spoiler                 these are good places
           warning, because this is              to hear them.

            The solution to the           McGee's thinking about things:

                                      had in mind (if any)

      I am reading a business planning book!
      Voluntarily!  Wow.

      Peter Schwartz is a cohort of Stewart Brand,
      and one of the folks associated with
      "The Long Now Foundation".  I picked this
      up off of the table they put out at the
      Long Now talks.

      It's essentially about the virtues of
      scenario planning -- presented in the           In effect, the message
      style favored by biz books, which one           is that in the absence
      might both praise and condemn as "simple".      of any rigorous planning

      "The Unicorn Murders" (1935)                    different possibilities.

      This was my third or fourth time through
      "The Unicorn Murders" and I still have
      trouble remembering the various twists and
      turns.  I suspect that Carr had some trouble
      also, and I have my doubts he had this one
      planned out in advance of writing it.  As
      always, there's some impressive arm-waving
      and misdirection through out, and not one
      but *two* "secret passages" (in all but
      name) in the floor plan, and multiple people
      disguising themselves as other people
      throughout, all of which provides the
      necessary wiggle room to invent a "solution"
      that retroactively *almost* justifies the  
      previous events.

             But it turns out that
             this really is a novel
             with an interesting
             approach to structure:

             It's always, beginning
             then end, and then the
             middle.  The story
             commences only once you
             know the character's doom.

             A tricky business:
             beginnings can be              Another interesting touch:
             a drag, and the usual          the book veers between
             advice is to skip              first person and second person,
             them: "start the story         it's intended audience is
             as late as you can".           a dead man, the wild man,
                                            fighting irish, crazy artist

                                            a year.

                                            The narrator of the book
                                            is a relatively uninteresting
                                            character, whose life is

                 seems a lot more like a    of being conscious of the

                 point is she's going to    since she's essentially
                 abandon acting and         known to world as "Jack
                 become a writer?  Um,      Kerouac's Girlfriend"
                 no: she becomes a          (or one of them, at any rate).

                 her father-- because 
                 her boyfriend gives her
                 a camera.

      I think Johnson
      took the "don't                 This is a book
      write about                     with some
      writers" rule                   moments, but it
      too seriously.                  never seems to
                                      get off the dime.       (whatever
                                                              that means).
                                      It's a bit of a
                                      drag-- everything 
                                      has to be downer,
                                      you see, because
                                      you can't have
                                      anything *positive*
                                      in the fiction of a
                                      Serious Author
                                      published by The
                                      New Yorker.

                                               I had this funny feeling
                                               after reading it: where
                                               should I shelve this book?

                                               There's nowhere in
                                               particular that I want
                                               it to be.  Should I get
                                               rid of it?



  51. Maxwell Grant - "The Black Falcon" (1934)

        Maybe Grant was hitting his stride
        at this point... this is another
        one I would rate as being above average...
        for a "Shadow" novel.

           But then, about a third of the
           way through, there's a turning
           point where it takes a dive.

           Chapter XIII: "The Mustache Twirls"

               And there's an awful lot of
               superhuman prowess displayed
               in the fight against supercrook
               superfiends.

  52. C.S. Forrester - "Sink the Bismarck!" (1959)

         Very slim volume, targeted at the Y.A. market
         I suppose.  Essentially a newsreel with no
         dialog, a real-world game of "battleship"
         as each side tries to piece together
         clues about what the other is doing,
         make guesses about intentions, and decide
         what to do accordingly.

                        Forester plays this up as
                        a turning point in WWI:
                        if the Bismarck escaped,
                        history would have been
                        irreperably altered.


  53. G.K. Chesterton - "The Man Who Was Thursday"

         Methinks Chesterton-- who essentially 
         specialized in parables if not       
         sermons-in-story-form-- is at his best in 
         shorter works.

         This novel becomes a bit of a monotonous
         drag, as we go plodding along awaiting
         the next great twist-- most of which are 
         obvious after the first few of them
         indicate the direction he's going.

  57. Ian Fleming - "Doctor No" (1958)

      One of the alt.gothic gang mentioned
      that this was one of his favorites,
      so I decided it might make good
      Christmas reading.

      Actually, it's so close to the film
      version-- which was the first of 
      the Connery Bond's-- there isn't a 
      lot of point in reading it, except
      to note the small differences that
      do exist.

        Fleming had quite an obsession
        with torture going in those days.

        Quarrel is treated with some
        condescension, but is handled
        far better than in the film,
        where he's jeered at for         There's a bunch of stuff

        are entirely reasonable --       removed from the film.

        but requests a life insurance       The film has things
        policy be taken out on him so       adjusted so that
        his family will be cared for.       there are a few
                                            more fight scenes,
           (Also, the film                  and an additional
            contains the                    flirtation (the

            Bond to Quarrel:                much smaller role
            "Fetch my shoes.")              in the book).

                                                   (A point Noel Coward
          -- p 93, Chapter 9 "Close Shaves"        remarked on).



  58. John Dickson Carr - "The Eight of Swords" (1934) (rr)

      Begins in a comical mode,
      and it's clear it's
      going to be a battle
      of the blue noses
      against the red noses.

      Then, half way through, it
      gets grimmer, and there's the          Just at a guess, Carr
      mystery-novel author on stage          made the mistake of

          There are too many characters            in that the kindly,

          vaguely cheated (but what
          *motive*?).

          But at least this time Fell's
          explanation for why it had to
          be this person (or someone
          similar) seems reasonable.
