     I find one of the most

     this ziggurat.  In the center

     them for meaning, looking for             Comparing notes, I gather

          The weekend progresses:

                                                    we hear a

                       The billowing, nearly horizontal
                       hundred foot long flags were
                       recommended to me for their
                       "sheer physicality", so
                       I ride by there on bike, going
                       fast, parallel to them, as they
                       flap up and down.  I try to get
                       the timing right to duck side to
                       side... but frequently get beaned
                       on the head.

                                               In the background,
                                               someone is running
                                               a pyrotechnic machine
                                               bellowing huge black
                                               smoke rings into the
                                               air.


                  A truck keeps blowing it's
                  horn in a really obnoxious
                  way: ah, the water truck,
                  sprinkling the dusty roads,
                  warning people out of the
                  way?  But like the jingling
                  of the ice cream man,
                  it brings people running,
                  shedding clothes, crowding
                  in behind the truck.               And next time
                  They run bent over                 around I crowd in
                  to get a free shower.              the same way.





Being a negative kind of guy, I go
into Burning Man expecting to be
critical, e.g.  expecting to be
annoyed at an excessive focus on         (Laughing Squid Syndrome)
surreal, meaningless humor.

   I had joked that I'd like to do a
   "Serious Stuff Camp", with a board
   room table and chairs, a black board,
   and a case of reference books.  A
   sign at the entrance would warn that
   whacky humor was discouraged, and
   suggest leaving funny costumes at the
   door.  A box of thrift store ties
   would be provided to help people
   focus.

       Instead: much of the humor
       seems genuinely funny to me.
       Much of the art seems
       genuinely beautiful.  If
       something seems lame, two
       steps to the left you find
       something else that definitely
       isn't.

           And as for serious stuff...
           I find a small camp with two
           classrooms set up to teach one         ("Medicine Planet Center")
           hour courses in various
           things.  It comes complete with
           traditional school-room
           chairs, desk attached.

                 And in what seems like the
                 *real* center of the city,
                 just north of the man, is an
                 enormous "mausoleum" built from          (By David Best)
                 incredibly ornate wooden
                 pieces (the reused debris from
                 jigsaw puzzle manufacturing).
                 People are encouraged to add
                 messages on the walls,
                 epitaphs for the recent dead.
                 The atmosphere inside is
                 infectiously somber.  Walk in
                 there at any moment, and
                 you find people sobbing on all
                 sides.


                 Serious enough.



  Just across the Esplanade,
  I'm once again working on
  my tower structure,
  standing straight-legged
  but bending over to dig in
  my cases of fasteners and
  tools.  I stand up and get
  ready to climb the tower
  again, and a woman with a                 A rule honored most often
  camera walks up behind me                 in the breech: ask permission
  saying "hey could you bend                to shoot.

  was a great shot."  I shrug               Critical-tits riders

the way the plya dust
has been encrusting it,
making the dark metal
seem to match the wooden
structure it rests in.
There's an older couple
standing to one
side... the man says
"looks like someone went
crazy with a jig-saw".
I explain that it's all
built with waste
material from puzzle
manufacturing.  "Except
for this coffin which is
made from destroyed

   it occurred to me later
   that they were a pretty
   classic example of
   Retirees on Vacation.
   Could it be that the
   article in the AAA
   magazine brought them in?


We walk up to the crowd
forming around the burn,
and choose a good place
to stand, and then the
waiting begins, the crowd
continues to thicken.

  A woman tries to shoulder
  through on my left.  I hold
  still, and pretend she's not          I've always hated
  there.  She tries an "Excuse          line-jumpers.
  me!" and I say "Really? Why?
  What makes you so fucking
  cool that you deserve to be
  up front?"  She just looks
  at me, eyes far too dark,
  and makes a move to kiss
  me.  I push her away and
  say "just fucking go to
  the back".  Someone takes
  her champaign glass away
  from her for a moment to
  keep from spilling it on us.
  Then she and her trailing
  boy friend squeeze through
  and go up to the front of
  the circle.  One of the
  rangers tells them "look
  these people have been
  waiting here for hours..."
  so they move back a few
  rows, and everyone lets it            Too wasted for shame.
  slide.

     A little while later, I end up
     doing a similar maneuver, as
     yet another line-jumper tries
     to use me as a doorway.

        Then the late-comers behind us
        decide that we're too tall,
        and start yelling in
        increasing volume "Sit down!
        Everyone sit down!"  We all
        try this for a moment, but
        there are problems.  Sitting
        people take up more room then
        standing, there are people
        with bikes who can't get them
        out of the way, etc.  The
        late-comers behind us refuse to
        hear any of this, shouting
        things like "sit down!  People       Hindsight:  I should've
        will make room for you!"             have tried "Oh yeah?  So
                                             make room for us.  Everyone
                                             take two steps back."


            After awhile, I lose it, stand
            up and yell "You know what?!
            Have a nice fucking burn!"
            I run, stepping around and over
            the seated late-comers grabbing
            some by the shoulders, shaking
            them and yelling

               "See *everything*!
                See *everything*!"


            I don't regret making this
            scene, but a moment later I do
            feel bad about possibly
            bumming out the people I was
            hanging with.                        (They of course were
                                                 perfectly fine without
            I return to camp, and watch          me.  Though one seems to

            who hadn't even tried to brave
            the crowd.                              (Actually, I was raised
                                                    as a misanthrope, but
                                                    it didn't take.)


   The actual burn turns out to
   be totally overshadowed by a
   fireworks display that would
   be fine on the fourth, but
   seems out of place on the plya.
   At this distance, we make
   remarks like "Gotta make it
   bigger and better!" and "This          Before the burn: my windmill
   is so disneyland...".  I hear          spins, the flags rustle in the

                               This fluid flow pattern
                               is called the Von Karman

                               This is the same fluid flow

                               the wind blows past it.

                                               Later her husband comes
                                               up to me and congratulates

Walking from Illuminaughty to
Funk Camp, we get caught by a small
dust storm without our masks or
goggles.  I get my partner to walk
behind me, face pressed
against my back.  Whenever we're
ready to move I say "Okay. Right
foot first." And we try to move
as though our feet were tied together.
I hold my water bottle in
front of my eyes for protection,
though it's only slightly
transparent, but we're not moving
fast enough for this to matter.
We keep breaking down into giggles
as you'd expect, though the
funny part (to me) is that what

line "Right foot first."                     I just go around being serious
                                             and it works about as well.



For my personal art project,
I figured for my first time
out, I'd do something simple
I've wanted to play with for
a long time: build a wind harp.

   But to do that, I'd need some
   kind of structure to hold it
   up, like say a tower made out
   of the slotted angle iron I've
   been building things with
   lately.


      I've also been working
      with noise makers                   For performances at:

      Hearing the stray phrase
      "wind powered sculpture"
      makes me think about

                                                      of at Burning Man.
      The windmill design came
      easily, without much                            Two others were

      over the pipe to make                              One: a large

      bearing I mount it on was                          of two split
      already kicking around,                            55 gallon drums,
      though the hub design took                         spinning on a

      This being part of "fruit

      satin in the hopes of
      making the blades look         But high winds require
      more like bananas.             reefing the sails:
                                     very skinny bananas.
      (I'm lucky to get much
      assistance from the
      dangerbaby on the fabric
      work.)

         The tower design comes hard: I
         want a triangular cross-section
         because
           (1) it saves metal;
           (2) squares are boring;              The solution turned
                                                out to be a simple trick:
         But doing 60 degree angles with        On the awkward connections

                                                   bracing, anyway.

            I keep trying to think of                   No need to hack

                                          a bit elaborate
                                          And I'd had a fever

                                          before, and I don't
                                          think I'd recovered
                                          my strength.

                                          I go to bed early
                                          and wake at dawn.

Talking about photography:
I comment that I've never
seen a shot of one of the
most common Burning Man
sights, a sea of tightly
packed cars and tents.


                 A green
                 tennis

                 rebar                later I climb up and study it
                 tent                 closely: somehow the tower had
                 stake.               been vibrating with a twisting
                                      oscillation so extreme that a

                                      of this really matters.  The
                                      tower just needs to be braced
                                      better, made more rigid.
