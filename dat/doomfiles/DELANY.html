This could be about:
   Delany, the academic.
   Delany, the musician.
   Delany, the madman.                 Some of these terms ("madman",
   Delany, the mulatto.                "hippie", "queer"...) probably
   Delany, the queer.                  seem too negative: they call up
   Delany, the hippie.                 stereotypes with associations
                                       that don't match reality.
  This is largely about Delany,           
  the science fiction writer.                                         
                                       The same can be said of the       
                                       term "science fiction writer".      
                                                                         
                                                                     

Delany hit the scene in the late
sixties, cranking SF novels in
his teens and picking up Nebula         
awards in his early twenties.        Just about everything Delany

The later novel "Star's In My

a beautiful job of detailing

                                    At the beginning of the novel,    
                                    Rydra is frustrated about an  
                                    inability to let someone know    
                                    that she likes him:            
                                    A communication problem that

So, this is a really great book.
There are other Delany books that are
great in a similar way:
"The Einstein Intersection";  "Nova";
The stories in "Driftglass".

One that's great in a different way -- 
"Dhalgren":

A long piece of prose, detailing
the wanderings of a partially
amnesiac character through a
surrealistic, post-disaster city
that almost looks like it's
going to make sense in a few
places.                             <A HREF="TOADKEEPER.html">TOADKEEPER</A>

Delany also published an autobiography, 
covering the early 60s: 
"The Motion of Light in Water"

              Delany laments the lack of permanence
              in non-standard relationships.

              He doesn't speculate about why they aren't.



"The Heavenly Breakfast" is
another autobiography, this one
structured like a novel,
covering the "winter of love":
the winter of 1968.

At that time Delany was living in
a commune: a large group of
people living in an apartment
with just a kitchen, living
room and bathroom, all without
doors.  They were all in a band
called "The Heavenly Breakfast",
though the bills were paid mostly
by drug dealing.

One scene: Delany sits at the
kitchen table, writing in a note
book.  Two women get up to go into
the main room to have sex with each
other.  A guy who had been hanging
around the commune off and on looks
at Delany and says something like
"Should I follow them?"  Delany
shrugs and says that that's up to
him to decide.  The guy goes into
the other room, but a little while
later comes back.  He says
something about how they kept doing
things to each other even after he
joined them.  Evidently his fantasy
was to have the two of them focused
on him?  He leaves, and after that
isn't seen around very much.

The commune itself eventually
breaks up: Delany says this is

"Tides of Lust" is Delany's first                 Delany defends pornography,
(intentionally) pornographic novel.               as an uncoventional,

and realities....                                 themselves.

       And with Delany himself?  Has he ever noticed the
       differences between his fictional relationships,
       and the reality?  I presume so, but I've never seen
       him discuss it...
