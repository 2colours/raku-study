Allen Churchill, in "The Improper Bohemians" (1959)
describes an event from 1917 when Greenwich Village       <A HREF="IMPROPER_BOHEMIANS.html">IMPROPER_BOHEMIANS</A>
seceded from the United States, and it's declaration
of independence was read in Washington
Square. (p. 155-157)

This was a follow-on to an early
attempt by Ellis O. Jones in 1913       Churchill has a thesis about a shift
which was (a) set in Central Park       from serious to whacky to roaring
and (b) rained out.  It was poorly      (as in 20s), so he plays this like so:

doorway, [she] found herself ascending a
steep stairway to emerge on top of the
stately Arch.  Here she was surrounded
by a low, parapet-like wall which made,
she instantly decided, the perfect spot
for launching a new revolution.  After
reading a Secession Proclamation she
would, in the manner of Ellis O. Jones,
call upon President Wilson to protect
Greenwich Village as one of the small
nations."

"Hastening to the ground, she scoured the
Village for Chinese lanterns, red balloons,         A little more detail on

and then, says a chronicle of the event,
'the proclaimers ate and drank throughout
the night.'  When finally the
revolutionists departed, they secured the
red balloons to the wall surrounding the
top of the arch and 'in the morning, police
and passerby were dumfounded to see the
proud balloons sailing into the raw air
from the top of the Arch.'"
