So, back in 2014, I was talking about wrapping up this
project... on the off chance that anyone is wondering
what happened to that:

(1) recently I got involved with fixing-up the emacs
lisp code I use to edit this stuff, and now that it's
working better, I'm finding I'm more interested in
writing in this format.

(2) Also, I gave up on the experiment of "blogging" at the
dailykos-- mainly I quit as a small protest about the
gollout of new software ("DK5"), but Markos demonstrating
he can't tell a "better democrat" when he sees one was
really the last straw (actually I've got multiple problems
with the place, maybe I should write something about that...).

    There's always an information assymetry between the

Continuing to work over a single essay, Pauline Kael's "Trash,
Art and the Movies" from 1969, the closest thing to an overaching

Hiroki Azuma's "Otaku: Japan's Database Animals" (2001),
sheds a little bit of light on the Otaku sub-culture,
and shows that wonky postmodern cultural commentary
did not die with the last century:

Your culture is a database, you are an animal:

    <A HREF="OTAKU_BASE.html">OTAKU_BASE</A>

Azuma uses a very familiar human/animal distinction:

    <A HREF="OTAKU_ANIMAL.html">OTAKU_ANIMAL</A>

The slice of teenage otaku life (in a manner of speaking), 
a defense of sorts for fantasies of pedophilia (as long as

"Otaku" is essentially just a kid that watches a lot of

Given the Hegelian human-animal distinction, should we
then embrace back-to-nature movements?

I've got my tools working that let's me swap chunks
of doomfiles nodes around in the browse sequence...
so I've been doing a lot of rearrangement of where
the "NEXT" links go.

including the point that Kerouac was originally being
awfully loopy when he claimed that a "beat generation"

more egocentric than usual: a wikipedia flaw the "no
original research" requires that you report
consensus wisdom even if you know it's wrong:

    <A HREF="WRONG_CONSENSUS.html">WRONG_CONSENSUS</A>

And now, never before published in this venue...

   <A HREF="STEIN.html">STEIN</A>

Notes on the novel Frankenstein, with some attention to the
actual technology that Shelley had in mind (note, nothing
much about electricity), followed up by some wild
speculation on how the Frankenstein scenario might have
played out if you didn't have some narrowminded notion about
the un-holiness of "playing God" i.e. creating a new
lifeform.  (Actually I wrote this stuff a few years
ago, and read it on the air in March 2000... and posted
a copy to alt.gothic in 2001 or so...)

Also put out some entertaining (to me) ranting
about a bad mystery novel from 1928:

Kevin Kelly's "Out of Control", and the bit about Sullivan's
work with system adaptability vs a connectivity parameter:

    <A HREF="CONTROL.html">CONTROL</A>

Some old, probably excessive, ranting about the Flaubert
novel "Madame Bovary", it's cyncism, and some dark
suspicions about why it may have been so well-regarded by
those who regard it well:

    <A HREF="BOVARY.html">BOVARY</A>

About Chaim Bertman's autobiographical novel, and the goal

an example of not quite achieving it:

A quote from the same, about extreme attempts

    <A HREF="FLORENCE.html">FLORENCE</A>


And this stack has got a hell of a lot of stuff in it,
which I'm not in the mood to describe in detail.

Note: idea for a privacy sigil, to keep yourself out

appeal of games:

    <A HREF="GAMES.html">GAMES</A>


11/3/02

The node <A HREF="SURVIVAL.html">SURVIVAL</A> is supposed to
establish what may be a stunningly obvious point: the
purpose of human life is not just to live, and hence you
can't come up with a complete, rigorous moral/ethical code
based on the needs for individual or group survial.

While writing this, I decided I needed to extract this
bit from the DRUGS node and give it a node of its own:

     <A HREF="HAPPY_BREED.html">HAPPY_BREED</A>

(About the John Sladek story.)

And similarly, it turns out that it makes more sense to move
the "vanilla existentialism" stuff from IRONTHORN to:

     <A HREF="LIFE.html">LIFE</A>



10/19/02

Brace yourself, I'm about to press
the "irony" button:

I wrote this material, in which I
discuss the problem of writers
who ruin things with later re-writes:

   <A HREF="FIRST_THINKS_FIRST.html">FIRST_THINKS_FIRST</A>
   <A HREF="NOW_AND_LATER.html">NOW_AND_LATER </A>

The point being that maybe you should
just go with your first thought, and
never revise once you've published.
Stop questioning the judgement
of the version of yourself that was
probably more familiar with the material
than you are now.

Then I started thinking about where this
should go in the doomfiles "browse sequence".

Then I proceeded to rip apart the existing
browse sequence, and try to re-arrange everything
into a new order.

        Who knows what damage I've done,
        I certainly don't.

Other new nodes added while I was doing
this "great" re-arrangement:

Phil Jose Farmer's _Maker of Universes_ series,
and it's relatives:

   <A HREF="MAKER.html">MAKER</A>

Tidbit about improvisation in music:

   <A HREF="IMPULSE.html">IMPULSE</A>

Notions about how to create creative music
(perhaps ala Eno's infamous deck of cards):

   <A HREF="SOUND_ADVICE.html">SOUND_ADVICE</A>

Pretentious little bit about terror at the inadequacies of
rationality:

   <A HREF="WASTELAND.html">WASTELAND</A>

The tendency to pick something to center your world
view on that's very often obviously bogus:

   <A HREF="FALSE_CENTER.html">FALSE_CENTER</A>

The act of naming, with an eye toward the problem of genre
names in music:

   <A HREF="ACTIVE_NAMING.html">ACTIVE_NAMING</A>

Musing on the definition of City:

   <A HREF="URB.html">URB</A>

Brief listing of some of the purposes of music:

   <A HREF="PURPOSES_OF_MUSIC.html">PURPOSES_OF_MUSIC</A>

Diamanda Galas = perfect, but perhaps not sincere.  So?

Another vanilla existentialism quickie:

   <A HREF="LIFE.html">LIFE</A>

Misconceptions about Leonard Cohen's "Sisters of Mercy":

   <A HREF="MERCY.html">MERCY</A>

Misconceptions about pop-music lyrics in general:

   <A HREF="TURNING.html">TURNING</A>

Yet another scheme: pop music that is not pop music:

   <A HREF="SUBVERSIVEPOP.html">SUBVERSIVEPOP</A>

The Strange Case of Freeman Dyson... constantly brilliant,
though somewhat inconstant:

   <A HREF="DYSON.html">DYSON</A>

Whew.

10/04/02

Wow, nearly a year since I've added something to this
mess...  Anyway, took a short piece about a trip to New York
that I wrote last June, and picked a place for it (after the
UNINTENDED->AGES sequence... it would be funny if
chronological order was the right thing to do now, recording
the natural flow of the thought...):

   <A HREF="REDEEMING_NEWYORK.html">REDEEMING_NEWYORK</A>

Breaking that theory immediately though, by putting a bunch
of the alt.gothic.bookworms material (reviews of Lewis's
"The Screwtape Letters" and Twain's "Letters from the Earth"
and so on) after the old "GODDEATH" node, which is funny
because GODDEATH totally contradicts the MORTALGOD piece
it leads up to:

   <A HREF="GODDEATH.html">GODDEATH</A>
   <A HREF="SCREWTAPE.html">SCREWTAPE</A>
   <A HREF="LETTERS_FROM_EARTH.html">LETTERS_FROM_EARTH</A>

   <A HREF="MORTALGOD.html">MORTALGOD</A>

10/05/01

Just wrote:
   <A HREF="UNINTENDED.html">UNINTENDED</A>

This is some jamming around the idea that the
limitations of human intelligence lead to a disconnect
between the desired and the beautiful.

In the "browse sequence", I'm putting it (and a slight
companion piece, AGES) after SENSATIONAL, and before NEOPUNK
(though getting it closer to <A HREF="PUNK.html">PUNK</A> might make more sense).

09/08/01

Added BURNING_MOMENTS, a description of some experiences
of my first trip to Burning Man in 2001.

   <A HREF="BURNING_MOMENTS.html">BURNING_MOMENTS</A>

I stuck this immediately before DRUGS (after SLOWCULPT),
though I suspect it will ultimately reside between <A HREF="SPLIT.html">SPLIT</A> and
<A HREF="STURGEON.html">STURGEON</A>.  (The general
reasoning: the Burning Man folks might be interested in
my philosphy, such as it is, about recreational drugs.)

And while I'm at it, I'm pushing out something I wrote six
months ago: musing about the probable impracticality of the
legendary/mythical "Key Parties":  <A HREF="KEYPART.html">KEYPART</A>

It seemed to fit pretty naturally between STRANGER and
GROUPS... it didn't take an hour to figure out where to put
something for once.

08/08/01

Some ramblings about greenesque refrigerator design,
the emergency preparedness problem.
Includes a stab at a new slogan:
"The emergency is your life", which I suspect
will not catch on.

   <A HREF="GREENISH-TINGE.html">GREENISH-TINGE</A>

04/14/01

Got around to adding my reaction to the movie
GROOVES (a fictional account of the SF Bay Area
rave scene):

     <A HREF="GROOVEN_IMAGES.html">GROOVEN_IMAGES</A>


06/30/00

Wrote up the events surrounding Bill Sheffield's suicide:

   <A HREF="WAYOUT.html">WAYOUT</A>

(and after a bit of thought, I appended it before
the AMERICANBEAUTY node in the browse sequence...)

05/01/00

Babbling about the movie "American Beauty",
and it's main theme, seeing beauty in
unlikely places:

   <A HREF="AMERICANBEAUTY.html">AMERICANBEAUTY</A>
   <A HREF="SENSATIONAL.html">SENSATIONAL</A>

Also wrote on the subject of the apparent
fear of sex that can be inferred from our
behavior, if not from our tastes in
fiction and so on.

    <A HREF="EXCUSES.html">EXCUSES</A>
    <A HREF="SEXUALENGINEERING.html">SEXUALENGINEERING</A>


04/30/00

And writing that stuff below left me
once again musing about truth, cynicism,
believability, persuasiveness and
so on...

    <A HREF="GENTLER.html">GENTLER</A>

Oh, and I also just decided to add
this silly thing:

    <A HREF="WHATSNEW.html">WHATSNEW</A>

And re-wrote the <A HREF="TOP.html">TOP</A>
to reflect the recent changes.

04/29/00

Added some new nodes going into some more detail
on my theories (and very occasional practice)
in picking up women:

    <A HREF="BACKING_IN.html">BACKING_IN</A>
    <A HREF="HOOK.html">HOOK</A>
    <A HREF="LINES.html">LINES</A>

04/25/00

Restored the browse sequence,
putting the Friday night whining
about relationships up top again.    <A HREF="DRYSPELL.html">DRYSPELL</A>

It doesn't reflect the condition of
my life anymore, but it remains one
of the better examples of a doomfile
node, and the subject probably has
a certain universal appeal...


04/10/00

Fixed the browse sequence
(there were some bugs, where
skipping forward wouldn't take
you to the same places as
skipping back; skipping forward
actually literally skipped most
of the nodes; punching 'next'
would take you into an infinite
loop and so on...).
