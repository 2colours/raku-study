# Update:
#   $() now represents the entire matched string,
#   the match  object is now $/, 
#   a list of all beginnings is returned by the
#   hyperoperator @()Â».beg.

# Hm? 
# But note that string positions are not necessarily integers in Perl
# 6. They are tagged with the units of the string, so that you can't
# inadvertently mix byte, codepoint, or grapheme offsets.
