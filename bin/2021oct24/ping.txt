In theory, when I save this file, the entire location should be
pushed to github.

In practice this is coming up empty:

https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2021oct24


Though this is out there:

https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/blob/main/notes/meeting_2021oct24.md

cd /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/
git add 2021oct24

git commit -a -m'last meeting location: 2021oct24'
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 300 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean  

git push -u origin main


And *now* the location is out there.
