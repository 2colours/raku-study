    ## try this theory: reduction only makes sense as a prefix on a single stream,
    ## and the fact it let's you put it in an infix position without warning is a flaw.


    # you can see how this could make sense:
    say [+] @nums + [+] @eves;  # 35

    # here we hit the implicit .elems call, *and* have a mysterious (to me) implicit +
    say [+] @nums  [+] @eves;  # 10
    # Oh, I see: @eves.elems happens first, it becomes one of two
    # things added to the @nums.elems.
    # Q: why the .elems call?  Something about the scalarness of what + wants.
